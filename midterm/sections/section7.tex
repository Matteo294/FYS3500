\subsection*{a}
Said $N(t)$ the number of atoms present at time $t$, the radioactive decay law states that
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{A} = -\frac{dN}{dt} = \lambda N
    \label{eq:decay_law}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is called the decay constant. \\
By integrating it in time one obtains 
\begin{equation}
    N(t) = N_0 \, e^{-\lambda t}
    \label{eq:decay_chain_first_atom}
\end{equation}
Now if we consider a chain decay of the type $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$ with initial conditions 
\begin{equation*}
    N_A(t=0) = N_0 \qquad N_B(t=0) = N_C(t=0) = 0
\end{equation*}
one can immediately obtain the number of $A$ atoms as a function of time by applying \ref{eq:decay_law}
\begin{equation*}
    N_A(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda_A t}
\end{equation*}
To study the number of atoms of type $B$ one has to take account of two factors: the number of "created" atoms by means of $A$'s decay, and
the number of atoms decayed into $C$. This means that the radioactive law reads 
\begin{equation*}
    N_B(t) = -\frac{1}{\lambda_B}\frac{dN_B(t)}{dt} + N_{A \to B}(t)
\end{equation*}
where the first term takes account of the fact on the right side member represents the $B$'s decay and the the last term 
represents the number of $B$ obtained by $A$'s decaying. \\
One can now substitute \ref{eq:decay_chain_first_atom} obtaining 
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{dN_B(t)}{dt} + \lambda_B N_B(t) =  N_0 \, e^{-\lambda_A t}
\end{equation*}
The general solution of this differential equation is 
\begin{equation*}
    N_B(t) = e^{-A(t)} \ \left(N_B(0) + \int_0^t N_0 e^{-\lambda_A s} e^{A(s)} \, ds \right)
\end{equation*}
where $A(s) = \lambda_B \int dt = \lambda_B t$. Hence
\begin{gather*}
N_B(t) = e^{-\lambda_B t} \ \int_0^t N_0 e^{-(\lambda_A - \lambda_B) s} \, ds 
= \frac{N_0 \, e^{-\lambda_B t}}{\lambda_A - \lambda_B} \ \left(1 - e^{-(\lambda_A - \lambda_B) t}\right) = \\
= N_0 \, \frac{e^{-\lambda_A t} - e^{-\lambda_B t}}{\lambda_B - \lambda_A}
\end{gather*}

\subsubsection*{b}
Let us consider the single-decay law 
\begin{equation*}
    N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}
\end{equation*}
One can notice here that $\lambda$'s physical units are inverse of time. The time $t_{1/2}$ is defined as the time necessary to halve the number of atoms fro $N_0$. 
This can be found by imposing $N(t) = N_0/2$ and solving for $t$ one obtains 
\begin{equation*}
    t_{1/2} = \frac{1}{\lambda} \, \log 2 \equiv \tau \log 2
\end{equation*}
where I introduced the mean lifetime $\tau \equiv 1/\lambda$. This last term, which has units of time, has a particular meaning. To understand this, one can first think 
of 
\begin{equation*}
    p(t) = \frac{N(t)}{\int N(t) \, dt}
\end{equation*} 
as a probability distribution function related to the probability of a particle to decay. One can then calculate the expected lifetime of such particle
\begin{equation*}
    \left\langle t \right\rangle = \frac{\int t N(t) \, dt}{\int N(t) \, dt} = \frac{\int_0^{\infty} te^{-\lambda t} \, dt}{\int_0^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t}} = \frac{1}{\lambda}
\end{equation*}
and it is exactly $\tau$. \\
Another interesting quantity is the natural decay width $\Gamma$. One can make plot the probability of a decay to occur as function of the decaying particle's energy: this is given by the
Breit Wigner formula. The half width at half maximum of this distribution is the factor $\Gamma$ which has units of energy and is related to the average lifetime of the particle trough the 
energy-time uncertainty relation
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta E \, \Delta t >= \frac{\hbar}{2}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection*{c}
$1mCi = 37MBq$. Taking the solution
\begin{equation*}
    N_1(t) = N_0 \, e^{-\lambda t}
\end{equation*}
and imposing $\mathcal{A}(t=0) = -\frac{dN_1(t)}{dt}|_{t=0} = 37MBq$ one obtains
\begin{equation*}
    N_0 = \frac{37 MBq}{\lambda} \simeq 29689798324
\end{equation*}
